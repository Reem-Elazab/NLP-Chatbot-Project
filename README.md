# Jaz Almaza Bay Hotel Chatbot

A **Streamlit-powered conversational AI** for hotel information retrieval, leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with LangChain, vector search, and Groq-hosted LLMs.

---

## üåü Features

- **Conversational Chatbot**: Friendly web UI, remembers chat history per user session.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Answers questions using actual hotel documentation (PDF), not just LLM ‚Äúmemory.‚Äù
- **Context-Aware QA**: Handles follow-up questions by reformulating them for accurate context retrieval.
- **Secure LLM Integration**: Uses Groq-hosted large language models with API key control.
- **Embeddings & Vector Search**: Fast, relevant document lookup using HuggingFace MiniLM and ChromaDB.
- **Session Management**: Each conversation is kept separate via session IDs.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- streamlit
- langchain
- chromadb
- python-dotenv
- torch
- Groq API Key
- HuggingFace Token
- Your hotel PDF file (default: `Jaz_Almaza_Beach_Resort_Brochure.pdf`)

Install everything with:

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community langchain-core langchain-huggingface langchain-groq chromadb python-dotenv torch
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup: Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with the following content:

```
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

- `HF_TOKEN`: [Get from HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: [Get from Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)

‚ùó **Never commit your `.env` file!**

## üß† How It Works

1. **PDF Loading**: The brochure is split into overlapping chunks for better search.
2. **Vector Embedding**: Each chunk is converted into embeddings via MiniLM.
3. **Chroma Vectorstore**: Chunks are stored for fast similarity search.
4. **User Input Processing**:
   - Reformulates follow-up questions using history.
   - Retrieves relevant chunks from the PDF.
   - Feeds them + your question into a Groq-hosted LLM.
   - Generates an answer **based on real content**.
5. **Session Memory**: Each session has unique history, tracked via session IDs.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Place your PDF** in the project folder. Rename or update the file path in the code if needed.
2. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
3. **Configure in the UI**:
   - Enter a custom Session ID in the sidebar (optional).
4. **Start Chatting**:
   - Ask anything about the hotel: services, hours, amenities, etc.
   - Bot responds with real info from the brochure.
